[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a widely used static site generator that powers lots of websites, also this one.
I have created two easy configurable and minimal themes. You can use them how you want. They are open source on Github - both licensed under MIT.

### single-page theme
This theme generates only one html page, but with all the features, you would expect from a blog. Used in this blog!

### material theme
