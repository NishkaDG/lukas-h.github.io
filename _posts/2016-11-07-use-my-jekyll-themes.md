The [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator is a widely used tool, that powers lots of websites, also this one.
I have created two easy configurable and minimal themes. You can use them how you want. they are open source on Github - both licensed under MIT.

## fresh material based theme
[See the demo](http://himsel.me/material-theme/) or the [Github Project](https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme)

## single-page theme (*used here*)
This theme is only one html page, but with all the features, you would expect from a blog.
