[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a widely used static site generator that powers lots of websites, also this one.
I have created two easy configurable and minimal themes. You can use them how you want. They are open source on Github - both licensed under MIT.

### material theme
[See the demo](http://himsel.me/material-theme/) or the [Github Project](https://github.com/lukas-h/material-theme)

### onepage theme
This theme generates only one html page, used here in this blog!
